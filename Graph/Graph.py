"""A way of representing Simple Undirected graphs.

A simple representation of graph as dictioanry of sets.
Every vertex has a label, which is used to access it in the graph.
Graph is a dictionary with keys as vertex labels, and the values as the
adjacency list of these vertices.
An adjacency list is itself a dictionary with keys as vertex labels and values
are the corresponding edge objects.
Storing the edge objects is useful as they may store additional information
about the edge, like weights, labels, etc.
An edge is represented as a pair of vertex labels.

Inspired largely by implementation in
